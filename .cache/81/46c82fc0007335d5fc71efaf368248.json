This is how CameraKit\n * implements simple dependency injection.\n *\n * Dependency injection is a way to decouple the *use* of a dependency from the *creation* of that dependency. This\n * improves modularity and re-usability, since components only care about the *interfaces* of dependencies (since that\n * determines their use) and not about their concrete creation. New implementations of a particular dependency may be\n * provided without the need to change any of the consumers of that dependency.\n *\n * There are a few commonly-used terms used when talking about dependency injection:\n *\n *   - Container (or Injector): Maintains a registry of all available Services and understands how to create them.\n *   - Service: Anything that can be provided by the Container is called a Service – this can be a value of any type.\n *   - Token: Each Service is associated with a unique name, or Token. In order to obtain a Service from the Container,\n *     the consumer must provide the Token corresponding to that Service.\n *   - InjectableFunction: Services are created by InjectableFunctions. When adding a Service to a Container, the\n *     Service provider gives the Container a InjectableFunction which, when called will return the Service. These\n *     InjectableFunctions may themselves use other Services, which will be passed to them as arguments.\n *\n * Services are, by default, singletons – that is, each call to `get()` a particular Service will return a reference\n * to the same value. In other words, InjectableFunctions are only invoked once. If multiple instances of a Service are\n * desired, a new Container can be created using the `copy([Token])` method – passing a Token to this method forces the\n * new Container to recreate the corresponding Service (the InjectableFunction will be invoked again). We say that the\n * Service is then \"scoped\" to the new Container.\n *\n *\n * One common downside of many dependency injection implementations is that the dependency graph formed by the various\n * Services can only be validated at runtime. That is, if a dependency is missing or a circular dependency is found, the\n * developer must wait until runtime to discover the error. These errors can often be confusing and hard to debug.\n *\n * This implementation eliminates this issue by moving these sorts of errors to compile time. If an unknown dependency\n * is used in a InjectableFunction, for example, the code simply won't compile.\n *\n * To achieve this, we do lose the ability to implicitly define the dependency graph, as is common with many dependency\n * injection frameworks that employ decorators to define Services and their dependencies. Instead, the dependency graph\n * must be constructed explicitly, step-by-step, via successive calls to the `provide()` method. This is a suitable\n * trade-off for CameraKit, as there are a relatively small number of Services.\n *\n * Here's a simple example of Container usage:\n * ```ts\n * const fooFactory = Injectable('Foo', () => new Foo())\n * const barFactory = Injectable('Bar', ['Foo'] as const, (foo: Foo) => new Bar(foo))\n * const container = Container.empy()\n *   .provide(fooFactory)\n *   .provide(barFactory)\n *\n * const bar: Bar = container.get('Bar')\n * ```\n */\n/** @internal */\nclass Container {\n  static provides(fnOrContainer) {\n    // Although the `provides` method has overloads that match both members of the union type separately, it does\n    // not match the union type itself, so the compiler forces us to branch and handle each type within the union\n    // separately.

This is how CameraKit\n * implements simple dependency injection.\n *\n * Dependency injection is a way to decouple the *use* of a dependency from the *creation* of that dependency. This\n * improves modularity and re-usability, since components only care about the *interfaces* of dependencies (since that\n * determines their use) and not about their concrete creation. New implementations of a particular dependency may be\n * provided without the need to change any of the consumers of that dependency.\n *\n * There are a few commonly-used terms used when talking about dependency injection:\n *\n *   - Container (or Injector): Maintains a registry of all available Services and understands how to create them.\n *   - Service: Anything that can be provided by the Container is called a Service – this can be a value of any type.\n *   - Token: Each Service is associated with a unique name, or Token. In order to obtain a Service from the Container,\n *     the consumer must provide the Token corresponding to that Service.\n *   - InjectableFunction: Services are created by InjectableFunctions. When adding a Service to a Container, the\n *     Service provider gives the Container a InjectableFunction which, when called will return the Service. These\n *     InjectableFunctions may themselves use other Services, which will be passed to them as arguments.\n *\n * Services are, by default, singletons – that is, each call to `get()` a particular Service will return a reference\n * to the same value. In other words, InjectableFunctions are only invoked once. If multiple instances of a Service are\n * desired, a new Container can be created using the `copy([Token])` method – passing a Token to this method forces the\n * new Container to recreate the corresponding Service (the InjectableFunction will be invoked again). We say that the\n * Service is then \"scoped\" to the new Container.\n *\n *\n * One common downside of many dependency injection implementations is that the dependency graph formed by the various\n * Services can only be validated at runtime. That is, if a dependency is missing or a circular dependency is found, the\n * developer must wait until runtime to discover the error. These errors can often be confusing and hard to debug.\n *\n * This implementation eliminates this issue by moving these sorts of errors to compile time. If an unknown dependency\n * is used in a InjectableFunction, for example, the code simply won't compile.\n *\n * To achieve this, we do lose the ability to implicitly define the dependency graph, as is common with many dependency\n * injection frameworks that employ decorators to define Services and their dependencies. Instead, the dependency graph\n * must be constructed explicitly, step-by-step, via successive calls to the `provide()` method. This is a suitable\n * trade-off for CameraKit, as there are a relatively small number of Services.\n *\n * Here's a simple example of Container usage:\n * ```ts\n * const fooFactory = Injectable('Foo', () => new Foo())\n * const barFactory = Injectable('Bar', ['Foo'] as const, (foo: Foo) => new Bar(foo))\n * const container = Container.empy()\n *   .provide(fooFactory)\n *   .provide(barFactory)\n *\n * const bar: Bar = container.get('Bar')\n * ```\n */\n/** @internal */\nexport class Container<Services = {}> {\n    /**\n     * Create a new [Container] by providing a [PartialContainer] that has no dependencies.\n     */\n    static provides<Services>(container: PartialContainer<Services, {}> | Container<Services>): Container<Services>;\n\n    /**\n     * Create a new [Container] by providing a Service that has no dependencies.\n     */\n    static provides<Token extends string, Service>(\n        fn: InjectableFunction<{}, [], Token, Service>\n    ): Container<AddService<{}, Token, Service>>;\n\n    static provides(\n        fnOrContainer: InjectableFunction<{}, [], string, any> | PartialContainer<any, {}> | Container<any>\n    ): Container<any> {\n        // Although the `provides` method has overloads that match both members of the union type separately, it does\n        // not match the union type itself, so the compiler forces us to branch and handle each type within the union\n        // separately.
