When the final Handler in the chain returns, execution passes back up the\n * chain eventually returning to the caller.\n *\n * Each Handler chain begins with a \"raw\" Handler – this is a function which takes some request and returns some\n * response. A chain is then created by supplying a series of mapping functions – the ChainableHandler type – which will\n * be called with the `next` Handler in the chain.\n *\n * Ex:\n * ```ts\n * const handler = (request: string, metadata?: RequestMetadata) => Promise.resolve(`Responded to ${request}`)\n * const chainable = (next: Handler<string, string>) => (request: string, metadata?: RequestMetadata) => {\n *   return next(`modified ${request}`, metadata)\n * }\n *\n * const chain = new HandlerChainBuilder(handler)\n *   .map(chainable)\n *   .handler\n *\n * const response = await chain('hello')\n * expect(response).toBe('Responded to modified hello; 0')\n * ```\n * You can largely ignore the `metadata` argument present in the above example. This is the mechanism by which an\n * AbortSignal is passed to each Handler in the chain, but the only real requirement when implementing a Handler is\n * to pass this argument along to the `next` function. In fact, many Handlers will want to be generic over the type\n * of metadata:\n * ```ts\n * const chainable = <Meta>(next: Handler<string, string, Meta>) => (request: string, metadata: Meta) => {\n *   return next(`modified ${request}`, metadata)\n * }\n * ```\n * Actually, it's a very good idea for Handlers to be as generic as possible, since that will allow greater re-use. In\n * the above example, we don't do anything with the response from `next`, so we can let that be generic, too:\n * ```ts\n * const chainable = <Res, Meta>(next: Handler<string, Res, Meta>) => (request: string, metadata: Meta) => {\n *   return next(`modified ${request}`, metadata)\n * }\n * ```\n * Now if some other Handler in the chain decides to return a different response type, our Handler won't require any\n * changes to compile.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * Since execution passes from handler to handler in the chain, and then back, handlers have the opportunity to modify\n * or observe both the request and response. This might be useful for implementing serialization/deserialization, but\n * the simplest example that demonstrates this feature is measuring request latency:\n * ```ts\n * const latencyMeasuringHandler = <Req, Res, Meta>(next: Handler<Req, Res, Meta>) =>\n *   async (req: Req, metadata: Meta) => {\n *     const start = performance.now()\n *     const response = await next(req, metadata)\n *     const latency = performance.now() - start\n *     console.log(`latency for request ${request} was ${latency}`)\n *     return response\n *   }\n * ```\n * Execution is first passed to our measuring handler, which marks the `start` timestamp. Then it passes execution on\n * down the chain. After a response is received (by some handler down the chain), execution passes back up to our\n * handler here, which records the amount of time spent inside `next`.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * Handlers may also abort requests. They can do this in two ways:\n *   1. Create an `AbortController` and add its `AbortSignal` to the `metadata` object when calling `next`.\n *   2. Resolve its returned Promise.\n *\n * The first approach is straightforward, but the second may benefit from an example – the simplest is a handler which\n * will timeout a request:\n * ```ts\n * const timeoutHandler = <Req, Res, Meta>(next: Handler<Req, Res, Meta>) => (req: Req, metadata: Meta) => {\n *   return Promise.race([\n *     next(req, metadata),\n *     sleep(1000),\n *   ])\n * }\n * ```\n * The Promise returned by this handler will resolve either when the `next` handler resolves or 1 second has elapsed,\n * whichever happens first. If the timeout happens first, we want the `next` handler to recieve an abort signal so that\n * it can terminate early (since its result is no longer needed).\n *\n * HandlerChainBuilder makes this happen by observing when each handler completes, and sending an abort signal to all\n * the handlers \"downstream\" from the aborting handler.\n */\nclass HandlerChainBuilder {\n  constructor(inner) {\n    // The TS compiler has the following behavior:\n    //\n    // class Infer<T extends SomeType | undefined> { constructor(f: (t?: T) => void) {} }\n    // const f = (t?: SomeType) => {}\n    // const i = new Infer(f)\n    //\n    // The type of `i` is inferred to be `Infer<SomeType>` instead of `Infer<SomeType | undefined>`, even though the\n    // type of `f`'s argument is `SomeType | undefined`.

This is the mechanism by which an\n * AbortSignal is passed to each Handler in the chain, but the only real requirement when implementing a Handler is\n * to pass this argument along to the `next` function. In fact, many Handlers will want to be generic over the type\n * of metadata:\n * ```ts\n * const chainable = <Meta>(next: Handler<string, string, Meta>) => (request: string, metadata: Meta) => {\n *   return next(`modified ${request}`, metadata)\n * }\n * ```\n * Actually, it's a very good idea for Handlers to be as generic as possible, since that will allow greater re-use. In\n * the above example, we don't do anything with the response from `next`, so we can let that be generic, too:\n * ```ts\n * const chainable = <Res, Meta>(next: Handler<string, Res, Meta>) => (request: string, metadata: Meta) => {\n *   return next(`modified ${request}`, metadata)\n * }\n * ```\n * Now if some other Handler in the chain decides to return a different response type, our Handler won't require any\n * changes to compile.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * Since execution passes from handler to handler in the chain, and then back, handlers have the opportunity to modify\n * or observe both the request and response. This might be useful for implementing serialization/deserialization, but\n * the simplest example that demonstrates this feature is measuring request latency:\n * ```ts\n * const latencyMeasuringHandler = <Req, Res, Meta>(next: Handler<Req, Res, Meta>) =>\n *   async (req: Req, metadata: Meta) => {\n *     const start = performance.now()\n *     const response = await next(req, metadata)\n *     const latency = performance.now() - start\n *     console.log(`latency for request ${request} was ${latency}`)\n *     return response\n *   }\n * ```\n * Execution is first passed to our measuring handler, which marks the `start` timestamp. Then it passes execution on\n * down the chain. After a response is received (by some handler down the chain), execution passes back up to our\n * handler here, which records the amount of time spent inside `next`.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * Handlers may also abort requests. They can do this in two ways:\n *   1. Create an `AbortController` and add its `AbortSignal` to the `metadata` object when calling `next`.\n *   2. Resolve its returned Promise.\n *\n * The first approach is straightforward, but the second may benefit from an example – the simplest is a handler which\n * will timeout a request:\n * ```ts\n * const timeoutHandler = <Req, Res, Meta>(next: Handler<Req, Res, Meta>) => (req: Req, metadata: Meta) => {\n *   return Promise.race([\n *     next(req, metadata),\n *     sleep(1000),\n *   ])\n * }\n * ```\n * The Promise returned by this handler will resolve either when the `next` handler resolves or 1 second has elapsed,\n * whichever happens first. If the timeout happens first, we want the `next` handler to recieve an abort signal so that\n * it can terminate early (since its result is no longer needed).\n *\n * HandlerChainBuilder makes this happen by observing when each handler completes, and sending an abort signal to all\n * the handlers \"downstream\" from the aborting handler.\n */\nexport class HandlerChainBuilder<Req, Res, Meta extends RequestMetadata> {\n    private readonly inner: Handler<Req, Res, Meta>;\n\n    constructor(inner: (req: Req, metadata: Meta) => Promise<Res>) {\n        // The TS compiler has the following behavior:\n        //\n        // class Infer<T extends SomeType | undefined> { constructor(f: (t?: T) => void) {} }\n        // const f = (t?: SomeType) => {}\n        // const i = new Infer(f)\n        //\n        // The type of `i` is inferred to be `Infer<SomeType>` instead of `Infer<SomeType | undefined>`, even though the\n        // type of `f`'s argument is `SomeType | undefined`.
